<div id="content"><h2>176. Is American Express (Amex) accepted in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can use an American Express card in Singapore. American
Express, Visa, and Mastercard are payment networks that have networks of
stores and merchants who accept their payment methods.</p>
<p>The American Express (Amex) Card is a popular credit card choice for
those living in Singapore due to its unique benefits. The chance to fly
with one of the world’s major airlines, Singapore Airlines, is the most
prevalent benefit in Singapore, especially if you hold one of their
co-branded cards, such as the Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Blue or
Ascend.</p>
<p>A lesser-known benefit American Express Singapore has is the ability
to take advantage of luxury staycation experiences and shopping perks
around Singapore. It is a great way for cardholders to enjoy a little
bit of luxury while earning rewards.</p>
<p>While Amex SG is a widely accepted form of payment at popular retail
chains and hotels, some small businesses may hesitate to accept it due
to its high transaction cost.</p>
<p>If you enjoy supporting small businesses, you may have encountered
the frustration of not being able to pay with your American Express
card. The higher transaction cost associated with this elite credit card
may make it less attractive to small business owners, limiting your
purchasing options.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a better option out there for you - <a class="text-link" href="https://www.paycec.com/us-en" target="_blank" title="PayCEC">PayCEC</a> . As a payment gateway
that caters to businesses of all sizes, PayCEC offers affordable
transaction fees that won’t break the bank for small business owners.
With a PayCEC account, you can have peace of mind knowing that you can
shop at your favorite local stores and support your community without
any payment restrictions.</p>

<h2>177. Is American Express (Amex) a good credit card in Singapore?</h2>
<p>With a plethora of dining rewards, exclusive promotions, and
cash-back options, Amex SG is the go-to choice for those who value
flexibility and convenience. Plus, with no minimum spending required,
you can enjoy the benefits of your cash rebates without worrying about
meeting a spending quota.</p>
<p>If you belong to the KrisFlyer frequent flyer program, American
Express has you covered. The American Express Singapore Airlines
KrisFlyer Credit Card or the KrisFlyer Ascend Credit Card allows for
simple mile conversions, making it an ideal alternative for frequent
flyers looking to maximize their benefits.</p>
<p>However, if you want simple and no-fuss cash back, the AMEX True
Cashback Credit Card is ideal, thanks to a flat 1.5% cash reward on all
qualified expenditures and no minimum spending requirement.</p>
<p>Benefits of American Express in Singapore include:</p>
<p>Rewards: All American Express consumer cards provide benefits in the
form of cashback, Membership Rewards points, or points or miles in
partner airline or hotel loyalty programs. American Express cards are
also frequently accompanied by a “welcome offer,” which allows new
cardholders to receive a bonus by spending a particular amount in the
first few months they have their card.</p>
<p>AmEx Offers: When you use your American Express card to shop at some
retailers, you may receive additional rewards or savings through offers
that show in your account. AmEx offers a wide range of merchant deals,
all of which are simple to activate.</p>
<p>Pay It and Plan It features: This option allows you to pay for your
purchases, large or little, one at a time, thereby saving you money on
interest.</p>
<p>An “apply with confidence” feature: When you see this option for a
card on AmEx’s website, you may verify your chances of acceptance
without affecting your credit scores.</p>

<h2>178. How to get Amex Black Card Singapore?</h2>
<p>The American Express Centurion Card, an invitation-only charge card
offered by American Express to platinum card holders who satisfy
specific conditions, is possibly the most valuable piece of anodized
titanium. This “hidden” card is designed for the privileged few, so the
perks correspond to their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Although there is no documented, surefire way to get accepted to the
Centurion card club, there are several “soft” standards you may complete
to increase your chances of approval. These are some general guidelines
to consider:</p>
<p>Have an NOA demonstrating income of more than S$1 million.</p>
<p>Spend at least S$300,000 on the AMEX Platinum Charge every year.</p>
<p>Request an Invite.</p>
<p>Even if you satisfy the spending and connection requirements, you may
not be accepted to the premium Centurion card club proactively.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you may now request an invitation! To request an invite,
follow these steps:</p>
<p>Go to the Centurion card site.</p>
<p>Click the button at the bottom of the form that reads Interested in
Centurion® Membership? Please Go Here</p>
<p>You’ll be taken to a brief form where you may input your name, Amex

<h2>179. How much is the American Express (Amex) Platinum fee in
Singapore?</h2>
<p>When choosing a credit card, the annual fee is a concern. The Amex
Platinum charge card in Singapore is S$324 (incl. of 8% GST with effect
from 1 Jan 2023).</p>
<p>If you have numerous cards linked to your account, the yearly fee for
each will be charged.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the annual charge is waived for the first
year, allowing you to test the card and determine whether it’s worth the
investment before committing to the entire amount.</p>
<p>The first two additional cards are always free, while future ones
cost $162 a piece.</p>
<p>In addition to the annual charge, the American Express Platinum
Credit Card requires a minimum income of S$80,000 or $6,667 per
month.</p>
<p>To be eligible for credit cards, you must have a personal or family
income of at least this amount.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that this is the American Express Platinum card
in Singapore with the lowest minimum income criteria among the three
available in Singapore.</p>
<p>The Platinum Reserve, a tier higher, requires a minimum annual income
of S$150,000, while the AMEX Platinum Charge, two tiers above, requires
a minimum annual income of S$200,000.</p>
<p>While the fee and minimum income criteria for the American Express
Platinum charge card appear high, I must evaluate the card’s features
and bonuses.</p>
<p>If the rich rewards points, travel insurance, and concierge services
are valuable to me, the yearly cost and minimum income restrictions may
be worth it.</p>

<h2>180. What is American Express (Amex) travel in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Amex Travel in Singapore, commonly known as American Express Travel
in Singapore, is a travel booking service where customers may book
flights, cruises, and hotel stays. As part of their membership, American
Express Credit Card Members get access to an extra service portal.</p>
<p>Cardholders can immediately utilize American Express Membership
Rewards Points for travel bookings. It is a more convenient option to
redeem points for travel through the portal rather than transferring
points to a partner airline or hotel company.</p>
<p>To utilize Amex Travel services in Singapore, you do not need an
American Express card. If you want to pay for your trip with points,
you’ll need an American Express card and Bank of Membership Rewards
points. While booking a reservation through the site, you may be able to
take advantage of special bargains and earn more points if you have an
American Express card.</p>
<p>For example, American Express Gold Card members would receive 3X
Membership Rewards points on flights (booked directly with airlines or
through Amextravel.com) and all Hotel Collection bonuses and
privileges.</p>
<p>How do American Express Travel credits work?</p>
<p>To use your trip credit, you must usually book via American Express
Travel. You might use the credit to buy flights, hotel stays, and/or
auto rentals, depending on your Amex card.</p>
<p>But, there are certain terms and conditions to be aware of:</p>
<p>You can only use your American Express Travel credit once, in a
single booking, so you can’t split it up.</p>
<p>You cannot combine the value of numerous Amex Travel credits to pay
the amount if you have more than one.</p>
<p>Your booking must be worth more than the credit amount. For example,
you may buy a $432 ticket with a $400 flight credit, but not a $372
flight.</p>
<p>Cruises may be booked through American Express Travel, however,
travel credits cannot be used to cover cruise fees.</p>
