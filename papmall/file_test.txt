<div id="content"><h2>56. Does Apple Pay work in Bosnia and Herzegovina?</h2>
<p>Apple Pay is not available in Bosnia and Herzegovina but is present
at 26 e-commerce stores in both regions.</p>
<p>Apple Pay makes it easier than ever to pay. Holding your iPhone or
Apple Watch in front of the card reader, you make the payment. It works
similarly to contactless payments, but you don’t have to whip out your
card. We’ll walk you through the process of using Apple Pay on your
iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p>Apple Pay enables contactless payments both in-store and online. It
works in the same way as contactless payments but without a bank card.
Hold your iPhone or Apple Watch near the card reader in the store,
confirm with a tap or a smile, and your purchase is complete. You can
also use Apple Pay to pay for your Coolblue products in the app and on
websites. You can add multiple cards to your Wallet, allowing you to use
Apple Pay to pay with different cards.</p>
<p>You pay for your purchases securely with Apple Pay. As a password,
you use your fingerprint or your smile. Holding a photo of your face in
front of the device also does not work. Apple Pay uses a device-specific
number and a unique transaction code when you make a purchase. That
means your credit card information is never saved on your device or
Apple’s servers. As a result, payments are always kept private, and
Apple never sees your credit card information.</p>

<h2>57. How to use Apple Pay in Bulgaria?</h2>
<p>To fully utilize Apple Pay in Bulgaria, it is advisable that users
configure their settings beforehand. It includes designating a default
payment card if they have multiple cards on the Wallet app, and enabling
the Apple Cash card to send and receive money in the Messages app.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Apple Pay in Bulgaria requires
two-factor authentication by default, which can be fulfilled by enabling
a passcode on the Watch or using a device that supports Touch or Face
ID. Alternatively, users can opt for an Express Transit Card to avoid
this authentication process.</p>
<p>Users can access these setup choices on their iPhones, Apple Watches,
and iPads by going to Settings &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay. On the Mac,
go to System Preferences &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria, Apple Pay is compatible with various payment scenarios,
but the bulk of customers will most likely use it on their iPhones or
Apple Watches.</p>
<p>Pay using iPhone or Apple Watch</p>
<p>To pay with Face ID on an iPhone, double-click the side button. The
phone then displays the default card and attempts to login using Face
ID. You may be required to enter a passcode if this is not possible.</p>
<p>On the Apple Watch, you can also double-click the side button to
display the specified card. After that, hold your phone or watch over
the contactless payment reader.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase something from the app or the Safari website,
click the Apple Pay button at the checkout. Then, depending on the
device, you’ll be asked to authenticate your identity using Touch ID or
Face ID. After that, confirm your payment information and the card you
want.</p>
<p>Send money with Messages</p>
<p>You and the recipient must be in the United States and have the Apple
Cash card enabled to send money via the Messages app. Navigate to
Settings &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay &gt; Apple Cash on your iPhone.
Following that, you can fund the card by connecting your bank
account.</p>
<p>After you’ve configured Apple Cash, all you have to do is tap the
Apple Pay or Apple Cash icon in an iMessage discussion to use it. You
will next be prompted to specify a sum and have the option to request or
transmit payment.</p>

<h2>58. Does Apple Pay work in Croatia?</h2>
<p>The answer is YES. After a long wait, Apple Pay is now available in
Croatia. Previously, it was possible to utilize the service while
pretending to be in another country. However, this is no longer the
case, and we can now legally use Apple Pay in Croatia.</p>
<p>Apple Pay is a service that allows iPhone and Apple Watch users to
pay with their devices. When using the Apple Pay service in the store,
users can lean their mobile phone on the POS device with contactless
payment, and the system will process the payment as if it were a
traditional card via built-in NFC.</p>
<p>Although some people are apprehensive about mobile payments, the
truth is that you will lose your wallet before your phone. And if you
do, these gadgets have several user authentication mechanisms and are
more secure than traditional cards.</p>
<p>When a purchase is made using Apple Pay, the unique Device Account
Number replaces the user’s credit card information, thus ensuring that
their sensitive financial details remain protected. This process helps
to prevent fraudulent activities and ensures that user data remains
secure throughout the payment process.</p>
<p>Which cards support the Apple Pay service in Croatia?</p>
<p>These are Mastercard, Visa, Monese, and Revoult in Croatia.</p>

<h2>59. Does Apple Pay work in the Czech Republic?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is working in the Czech Republic. On February 19,
2019, Apple Pay was launched in the Czech Republic. Apple Pay is
available in the Czech Republic through Air Bank, Česká spořitelna,
J&amp;T Banka, Komerční Banka, MONETA Money Bank, mBank, and payments
service Twisto.</p>
<p>Apple Pay is a payment service that allows users to add their credit
and/or debit card to a supported Apple® device and use it for
transactions at participating businesses via the Wallet app. It is
frequently recognized in many stores where customers shop.</p>
<p>In October 2014, Apple launched its mobile payment service in the
United States, allowing secure payments in stores and apps via the
iPhone and Apple Watch. Since then, Apple Pay has expanded to work in
apps and on the web on the iPad and Mac.</p>
<p>Apple adds new financial institutions that accept Apple Pay
regularly, and recent vendors in the United States to accept Apple Pay
at checkout include Target and Taco Bell.</p>

<h2>60. Does Apple Pay work in Estonia?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Estonia. Apple Pay is Apple’s payment
solution that allows users to make contactless payments with their
iPhone or Apple Watch smartwatch.</p>
<p>Starting on June 26, 2019, the Apple Pay payment solution will be
available in Estonia, with only online banks Monese, Revolut, and N26
currently supporting it.</p>
<p>Online banks Monese, Revolut and N26 currently support the payment
system.</p>
<p>Apple Pay will be officially supported in Estonia by online banks
Monese, Revolut, and N26 beginning Wednesday, according to Katrin Tibar,
Monese’s head of communications. Monese now accepts Apple Pay in 13 new
markets, bringing the total to 27 European countries.</p>
<p>According to Visa, Apple Pay works with the same types of contactless
payment terminals already widely used.</p>
<p>Approximately 90% of Estonian sales points have contactless card
payment terminals and aim to reach 100% coverage by 2020.</p>
<p>Thanks to Apple Pay and the Visa Token Service security solution,
people can use their iPhones and Apple Watch in the same manner they
have been using their bank cards up until now. According to Henning
Holtan, head of Visa’s Nordic and Baltic area, in a press release, no
account information would be divulged while using them.</p>
<p>The Apple Pay app allows users to utilize credit and debit cards.
However, unlike traditional payment methods, physical card numbers are
not stored on the device or Apple’s servers. Instead, the device is
assigned a unique account number through the Visa Token Service. Each
transaction is then authorized with a unique and dynamic security code,
providing an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>If an Apple Pay user’s device is lost or stolen, the digital account
number can be quickly disabled through the connected bank without
blocking or replacing the physical Visa card. This feature increases
consumer convenience while improving the overall security of the payment
system.</p>

<h2>61. Does Apple Pay work in Greece/Is Apple Pay available in Greece?</h2>
<p>Apple Pay is a new payment method available in Athens, Greece. The
most popular online payment methods in Greece are the major credit card
brands MasterCard and VISA (including VISA Electron), followed by
PayPal, Apple Pay, and traditional online bank transfers.</p>
<p>To use Apple Pay, you must first add your credit or debit card to the

<h2>62. Is Apple Pay available in Ireland/does Apple Pay work in
Ireland?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Ireland. Apple Pay has arrived in
Ireland as a new contactless payment option. The service enables iPhone
and Apple Watch owners to pay for their purchases at contactless
terminals in retail stores by using the NFC chips in their devices. To
use Apple Pay in Ireland, you must have an Apple device, such as an
iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch.</p>
<p>To use Apple Pay’s contactless payment function, open the Wallet app
on your iOS device and click the “Add a Card” option. Then, using your
device’s camera, scan the banking information to integrate your card
into the system. If the bank issuing your card accepts Apple Pay, it
will appear in the Wallet app.</p>
<p>Despite the highly anticipated arrival of Apple Pay in Ireland, its
implementation has been hampered by the limited backing of only two
banks, Ulster Bank and KBC, so far. Apple Pay supports the Wirecard Boon
prepaid card system in Ireland.</p>
<p>Despite supporting Android Pay in late 2016, Irish banks such as AIB
have yet to reach an agreement with Apple. A spokesperson for AIB said
that negotiations with Apple are ongoing, but there is ‘nothing to
announce at this time.’</p>
<p>On the other hand, many merchants in Ireland, including major
supermarkets such as Marks and Spencers, Lidl, Aldi, and Dunnes, are
advertising support for Apple Pay.</p>

<h2>64. Does Apple Pay work in Latvia?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Latvia.</p>
<p>From Wednesday, June 26, 2019, some “Visa” payment cardholders in
Latvia will be able to pay with “Apple Pay” at any contactless terminal
in Latvia, according to Evita Bille, the company’s public relations
consultant.</p>
<p>Customers can use contactless technology to make quick and convenient
transactions in stores, apps, and online with Apple Pay, which was

taxis, and many other places using iPhone and Apple Watch devices. There
is no need to manually enter your card or account information and
re-enter shipping and billing information when using Apply Pay in apps

<p>Another Apple Pay purchase requires only a glance or a touch, using
Face ID or Touch ID, or a device passcode. Apple Pay is a payment
technology that, through contactless technology and Visa tokenization,
enables customers to make quick and convenient purchases in stores,

<h2>65. Does Apple Pay work in Liechtenstein?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>Apple Pay in Liechtenstein is an Apple digital wallet that allows you
to make secure contactless purchases in stores, within selected apps,
and on participating websites using a compatible iPhone, Apple Watch,
iPad, or Mac. In stores, you place your phone or device over a
contactless reader, but unlike contactless cards, which allow you to pay
instantly, Apple Pay requires you to put your finger on the Touch ID
sensor on your phone or double-click the side button on your watch.</p>
<p>Using Apple Pay will not cost you anything extra. Purchases are
subject to a standard credit or debit card charge. Some retailers may
apply a credit or debit card surcharge to purchases made using any
payment method, including Apple Pay, contactless, or chip and PIN
transactions.</p>
<p>It is necessary to have an active data plan or Wi-Fi connection to
add your card to Apple Pay, i. Messages and data usage may incur
additional charges depending on your mobile device and network.</p>
<p>Once your card is added, you can use Apple Pay to make secure and
convenient contactless payments at stores or any other location that
accepts contactless payments. In addition, Apple Pay allows you to make
purchases within apps or on websites that display the “Buy with Apple
Pay” symbol.</p>

<h2>66. Does Apple Pay work in Lithuania?</h2>
<p>Customers aged 14 and up can use Apple Pay in Lithuania. Customers
aged 13 and up in Latvia and Estonia can likewise use Apple Pay. Payment
transactions with Apple Pay are more secure than standard credit card
payments. Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode are used to secure purchases
made on the iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, or iPad.</p>
<p>Apple Pay protects the user’s privacy by not storing the credit card
number on the device or Apple servers. Furthermore, retailers do not
receive the user’s card number during transactions, instead receiving
only the information needed to fulfill the order.</p>
<p>Using Apple Pay in stores is as easy as using contactless card
payments. Once you’ve added your credit or debit card to your Wallet,
hold your device near the payment terminal. Your device and the payment
terminal’s near-field communication technology work together to detect
your device. You can then confirm the payment with your passcode or
biometrics.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to note that adding your card to Apple Pay requires an
active data plan or Wi-Fi connection. Apple Pay is accepted in stores
that support tap-and-pay and apps and websites that display the “Buy
with Apple Pay” sign.</p>

<h2>67. Does Apple Pay work in Luxembourg?</h2>
<p>Apple Pay is now available in Luxembourg as part of its international
expansion. It is a mobile payment solution that offers a contactless

<h2>68. Does Apple Pay work in Macedonia?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Macedonia.</p>
<p>Apple Pay is a mobile payment system in Macedonia that allows you to
pay using your Apple devices at stores, apps, and on the web. Apple Pay
is more secure than a traditional credit, debit, or prepaid card. A Face
ID, Touch ID, or password is required to purchase an iPhone, Apple
Watch, Mac, or iPad. The card number and ID are not communicated with
the merchant, and neither the device nor the Apple server keeps the
actual card number.</p>
<p>The first step in utilizing Apple Pay is to add a card to the
Passbook app. Users have two options for doing so. One, they can import
an already-registered card and re-enter the security code or manually
enter new card information by typing it in or capturing it with the
built-in camera.</p>
<p>Once a card is added, a unique Device Account Number is created for
that card and securely stored within the iPhone’s Secure Element chip.
This chip assigns, encrypts, and stores the number, ensuring that the
actual card number is never transmitted.</p>
<p>When a user initiates a transaction, they need to authenticate it
using their fingerprint or passcode, then tap their iPhone against an
NFC-enabled terminal. The Device Account Number is transmitted through
the POS device and payment network, allowing for a seamless and secure
payment process.</p>

<p>Each transaction made through Apple Pay is safe with multiple layers
of protection. The process begins with the user validating their
identity using Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode. Once
authenticated, a one-time unique dynamic security code is generated and
sent along with the payment information to complete the transaction.
This code replaces the card number and adds layers of security by
ensuring that each transaction is unique and cannot be replicated.</p>

<h2>72. Does Apple Pay work in Poland/can you use Apple Pay in Poland?</h2>
<p>The answer is Yes. Apple Pay launched in Poland. iPhone, iPad, and
Mac users in Poland are now able to add eligible cards to the Wallet app
for use with Apple Pay.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the following banks in Poland accept Apple
Pay:</p>
<p>Raiffeisen Polbank</p>
<p>Nest Bank</p>
<p>BGZ BNP Paribas</p>
<p>Bank Zachodni WBK</p>
<p>mBank</p>
<p>Bank Pekao</p>
<p>Getin Bank</p>
<p>Alior Bank</p>
<p>Apple Pay is available in 78 countries, including small markets like
San Marino and Vatican City. Poland was chosen as the third market in
Eastern Europe and the twelfth in Europe to launch the service. Apple
entered a market where various types of mobile payments already exist
and performed admirably.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Polish Android users have paid using mobile banking apps
that support HCE mobile payments. Poland became the second country in
Europe to accept Android Pay in November 2016. (now Google Pay).</p>
<p>Given that Polish users are open to new technologies and mobile
payments are becoming increasingly popular, it is not surprising that
Apple Pay has entered this market. However, there is one significant
point that makes me pause.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between mobile payments in Poland and
Apple service. To demonstrate this, consider a few factors that
businesses consider from a market standpoint when deciding when to
introduce new products and services. Apple is no exception in this
regard.</p>

<h2>73. Does Apple Pay work in Portugal/can you use Apple Pay in
Portugal?</h2>
<p>Apple Pay is, indeed, accessible in Portugal.</p>
<p>Apple Pay is a safe and easy way to pay for products in Portugal
using your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac. Your iPhone becomes a
contactless credit card, and you may use it to pay everywhere you see
these symbols. Apple Pay can also be used to pay for items online or
through applications by linking straight to your debit or credit
card.</p>
<p>Which Portuguese stores accept Apple Pay?</p>
<p>The iPhone Maps app is the easiest way to find stores that accept
Apple Pay. Simply enter “Apple Pay” into the Maps search field to see a
list of nearby stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>Which banks work with Apple Pay in Portugal?</p>
<p>The traditional Portuguese bank currently supporting Apple Pay is
Crédito Agrícola. However, digital-only banks such as N26, Revolut, and
Monese are all available in Portugal and are Apple Pay-friendly. With
Apple’s strong influence, we can guarantee that more banks in Portugal
will soon be affiliated.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple Pay in Portugal also works with VISA and MasterCard
accounts.</p>
<p>What are the fees for Apple Pay in Portugal?</p>
<p>None! There are no fees. In Portugal, Apple Pay has no transaction
fees. Really.</p>
<p>There is a small fee to use Apple Cash, which allows you to send and
receive money from friends. However, Apple Cash is currently only
available in the United States.</p>
<p>How do I use Apple Pay in Portugal?</p>
<p>You can use Apple Pay in stores with this symbol, within the iPhone
app, or on the web in Safari. Some countries may need a PIN if the
transaction exceeds a particular threshold. In some situations, you may
need to sign a receipt. Because Apple Pay isn’t part of the Multibanco
system in Portugal, if a store or restaurant only accepts Multibanco,
check with the ATM first.</p>
<p>Using Apple Pay in the Store</p>
<p>You can use Apple Pay from Portugal wherever you can see contactless
symbols or Apple logos at the checkout counter.</p>
<p>Touch ID is activated by placing your phone on the card reader and
touching the home button on your phone. That’s it!</p>
<p>To use Apple Pay with your Face ID or iPhone password, double-click
the side button on your phone, view the phone screen, or enter your
password.</p>
<p>Using Apple Pay Online</p>
<p>If you are on a website that allows Apple Wallet, click the Apple Pay
logo and follow the instructions. As with face-to-face transactions, you
can use your Face ID, Touch ID, or password to confirm your
purchase.</p>

<h2>76. Is Apple Pay available in Russia/does Apple Pay work in Russia?</h2>
<p>Regrettably, Apple Pay is unavailable in Russia due to economic
sanctions imposed by the US and EU. Reuters reported that Apple Pay no
longer supports the Mir card payment system, which closed a loophole
that previously allowed Russians to continue using the service. Many</p>
<p>Because of financial sanctions imposed on Russia’s banks, including
VTB Group, Sovcombank, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, and Otkritie FC Bank,
Russian consumers have been barred from using Google Pay. Visa and
MasterCard suspended their operations in Russia earlier this month,
preventing Russians from using their credit or debit cards outside the
country or for international online payments.</p>
<p>Business Insider added that Russian customers are unable to use their
credit cards outside of Russia and cannot make online payments to
companies registered in sanctioned countries. The Russian invasion of
Ukraine caused a “Black Swan” event in the stock market, resulting in a
sell-off of technology stocks.</p>
<p>If the US government forbids the sale of hardware or software to
Russia, any company doing business in the nation will suffer. In Russia,
Apple would be unable to sell iPhones, deliver operating system updates,
or run the App Store.</p>

Serbian website, ProCredit bank will launch Apple Pay in the country on

<h2>78. Is Apple Pay available in Slovakia?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Slovakia. After several delays, Apple
Pay is now available in Slovakia. Slovakia joined the 40 countries that
have already launched this contactless payment technology for Apple

<p>Slovenska Sporitelna, Tatra Banka, mBank, 365 Banka, Postova Banka,
and J&amp;T Banka are among the Slovakian banks ready to offer Apple’s

Sporitea consumers joined. They performed 12,734 tokenizations in total,
meaning that some of them registered additional cards or devices.</p>

each to ensure no account information can be stolen in the event of a
hack or security breach.</p>

<h2>79. Is Apple Pay available in Slovenia?</h2>
<p>Yes, Apple Pay is available in Slovenia. Not to mention that many
major banks support Apple’s mobile payment solution: in Slovenia, the
list of banks that support Apple Pay includes the following
providers:</p>
<p>Monese</p>
<p>N26</p>
<p>Revolut</p>
<p>When using Apple Pay in Slovenia, users can be confident that their
payment information is safe and secure. Physical payment card
information is not sent during payment operations because virtual
payment card data cannot be linked to physical ones. This strategy aids
in reducing the possibility of fraud or abuse.</p>
<p>Apple Pay puts a great emphasis on privacy and security. When
consumers use Apple Pay to pay with a credit or debit card, neither the
device nor Apple’s servers keep the card number. Instead, a device is
allocated a unique number known as the Device Account Number, which is
then encrypted and safely stored on an electronic chip.</p>
<p>The Apple Pay / Apple Wallet payment system enables iPhone users to
store their payment cards in a single mobile application. When
purchasing in a physical store, consumers must keep their iPhones close
to the contactless scanner while using Touch ID. Users may effortlessly
pay for in-app purchases by touch and authenticate themselves with a
fingerprint or password.</p>
<p>Why pay with Apple Pay in Slovenia?</p>
<p>You can use your Activia Visa Inspire debit card and Activa
Mastercard to make purchases with Apple Pay mobile contactless
payment.</p>

never leaves your grasp while you make a purchase.</p>

<h2>80. Does Apple Pay work in Ukraine?</h2>
<p>Apple Pay is a popular payment method in Ukraine, with a higher
adoption rate than Google Pay. According to 2021 data, over 98 percent
of Apple Pay customers made payments through the system, while only 95
percent of Google Pay users did so.</p>
<p>Users hold their iPhone, Apple Watch, or another compatible device
near a contactless payment terminal to create transactions with Apple

MacBooks, and Apple Watches. Users can preserve their credit and debit
card information for future purchases.</p>

a credit card.</p>
<p>PrivatBank has already established a Google-powered solution called
Android Pay in Ukraine. Other financial institutions will follow
suit.</p>
<p>Because Apple Pay is only compatible with these devices, Apple only
brings the service to a country after a specified number of iPhones and
contactless debit and credit machines are present.</p>
